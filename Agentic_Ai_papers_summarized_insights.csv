Agentic AI-Driven Technical Troubleshooting for Enterprise Systems: A Novel Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation Paradigm,Rajat Khanda,"Technical troubleshooting in enterprise environments often involves navigating diverse, heterogeneous data sources to resolve complex issues effectively. This paper presents a novel agentic AI solution built on a Weighted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework tailored for enterprise technical troubleshooting. By dynamically weighting retrieval sources such as product manuals, internal knowledge bases, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides based on query context, the framework prioritizes the most relevant data. For instance, it gives precedence to product manuals for SKU-specific queries while incorporating general FAQs for broader issues. The system employs FAISS for efficient dense vector search, coupled with a dynamic aggregation mechanism to seamlessly integrate results from multiple sources. A Llama-based self-evaluator ensures the contextual accuracy and confidence of the generated responses before delivering them. This iterative cycle of retrieval and validation enhances precision, diversity, and reliability in response generation. Preliminary evaluations on large enterprise datasets demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving troubleshooting accuracy, reducing resolution times, and adapting to varied technical challenges. Future research aims to enhance the framework by integrating advanced conversational AI capabilities, enabling more interactive and intuitive troubleshooting experiences.

Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging A2A Protocol,"Idan Habler, Ken Huang, Vineeth Sai Narajala, Prashant Kulkarni","As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task execution integrity, and authentication methodologies. Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and effective A2A systems.
